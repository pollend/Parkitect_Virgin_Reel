The Virginia reel uses side friction like tracks. The tubs, have inward facing seating which spin freely on a chassis. The tubs are spun as they contacted the edges of the trough.

This coaster was made in conjunction with prolinesproductions who designed and built tubs and tracks that are featured in this mod.
